	A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent,<div>
		<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css4_pr_accent-color.php">w3schools css</a> 
	</div> and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.

<p class="textstyle">
	 In order for a paragraph to be effective, it must begin with a topic sentence, have sentences that support the main idea of that paragraph, and maintain a consistent flow.
